-Initial 10:29PM 5/11
I had a very late start on this project due to a huge database project being due the same night.

Start 3:17AM 5/12
I will try to get a few necessary functions finished this session.

End 4:00AM 5/12
I accomplished my goal, the nth0 function was very useful.
finished getCell, findStart, countCells, and mazeContains

Start 6:13PM 5/12
This session I will try and get the function to find the exit started and whatever other necessary functions I will need.

End 7:47PM 5/12
I have accomplished part of my goal, but I have some more things to add before I am done.
Added selects for the up down left and right actions, and applies for them
Made functions isValidMove, and findPath.

Start 8:51PM 5/12
I aim to complete the project in this session, by implementing a findPath function, and whatever else I need.

end 11:01PM 5/12
I accomplished what I set out to do and I finished the project, and added functions to run examples.
